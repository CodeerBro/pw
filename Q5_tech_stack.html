      <dt>Mongo DB</dt>
      <dd>MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.
        MongoDB is a popularly used NoSQL (not only SQL) database. Surely, you would have heard about this several times, if you’re interested in this topic. This tutorial on What is MongoDB will give you a deep understanding of its working and applications.
        Structured Query Language (SQL) existed even before the World Wide Web. However, as websites' functionality grew, developers wanted to generate web pages using content that could change over time without redeploying the code. As a result, Not only SQL or NoSQL was developed. NoSQL has relaxed ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties and guarantees better performance, scalability, flexibility, and reduced complexity. 

MongoDB was released on August 27th, 2009. Version 1 was basic, while version 2 introduced features like sharding, usable and special indices, geospatial features, memory, and concurrency improvements, among others. Version 3 came with an aggregation framework mainly as a supplement to the aging MapReduce framework.
MongoDB was created in 2009 as an open-source, highly scalable, robust, and free NoSQL database. It also has a commercial version. You can find MongoDB’s source code on GitHub.

MongoDB has cultivated a reputation as a versatile, flexible database and is currently used today as the backend data store of many high-profile businesses and organizations such as Forbes, Facebook, Google, IBM, Twitter, and many more. 

MongoDB is a non-relational database system. There are two primary database types: SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational). Relational databases store data in columns and rows. Organizations like Microsoft SQL Server Oracle and Sybase use the relational database management system (RDBMS).

On the other hand, NoSQL databases store schema-less, unstructured data in multiple collections and nodes. Non-relational databases don’t need fixed table sachems. NoSQL databases are scaled horizontally and support limited join queries.<br>

<dt> Express js</dt>

<dd>Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.
    Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.

It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.
Express was created to make APIs and web applications with ease,
It saves a lot of coding time almost by half and still makes web and 
mobile applications are efficient.
Another reason for using express is that it is written in javascript as javascript is an easy language even if you don't have a previous
knowledge of any language. Express lets so many new developers enter the field of web development. <br>
<br>
The reason behind creating an express framework for node js is:
<br>
Time-efficient <br>
Fast <br>
Economical <br>
Easy to learn <br>
Asynchronous <br>
<br>
Fast Server-Side Development 

The features of node js help express saving a lot of time.

Middleware

Middleware is a request handler that has access to the application's request-response cycle.

Routing 

It refers to how an application's endpoint's URLs respond to client requests.

Templating 

It provides templating engines to build dynamic content on the web pages by creating HTML templates on the server.

Debugging

<h4>
    Installation of the Express js in system
</h4>
To install Express JS on your system first you need to install node js then we will write a command to install express in the terminal.

npm install express
The express js will be installed in your system.

<dt>React js</dt>
<dd>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
    Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
<br>
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
<br>
We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
<br>
Today, front-end frameworks and libraries are becoming an essential part of the modern web development stack. React.js is a front-end library that has gradually become the go-to framework for modern web development within the JavaScript community.
<br>
<br>
The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.  

React’s primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of that application just like the V in a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern by providing the best and most efficient rendering execution. Rather than dealing with the whole user interface as a single unit, React.js encourages developers to separate these complex UIs into individual reusable components that form the building blocks of the whole UI. In doing so, the ReactJS framework combines the speed and efficiency of JavaScript with a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to render web pages faster and create highly dynamic and responsive web applications.
</dd>
<br>
<dt>History of React js</dt>

<dd>Back in 2011, Facebook had a massive user base and faced a challenging task. It wanted to offer users a richer user experience by building a more dynamic and more responsive user interface that was fast and highly performant.

    Jordan Walke, one of Facebook’s software engineers, created React to do just that. React simplified the development process by providing a more organized and structured way of building dynamic and interactive user interfaces with reusable components.
    
    Facebook’s news feed used it first. Due to its revolutionary approach to DOM manipulation and user interfaces, React dramatically changed Facebook’s approach to web development and quickly became popular in JavaScript’s ecosystem after its release to the open-source community.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>What does the react js do?</dt>
    <dd>
        Typically, you request a webpage by typing its URL into your web browser. Your browser then sends a request for that webpage, which your browser renders. If you click a link on that webpage to go to another page on the website, a new request is sent to the server to get that new page.

This back-and-forth loading pattern between your browser (the client) and the server continues for every new page or resource you try to access on a website. This typical approach to loading websites works just fine, but consider a very data-driven website. The back and forth loading of the full webpage would be redundant and create a poor user experience.
Additionally, when data changes in a traditional JavaScript application, it requires manual DOM manipulation to reflect these changes. You must identify which data changed and update the DOM to reflect those changes, resulting in a full page reload.
<br>
React takes a different approach by letting you build what’s known as a single-page application (SPA). A single-page application loads only a single HTML document on the first request. Then, it updates the specific portion, content, or body of the webpage that needs updating using JavaScript.

This pattern is known as client-side routing because the client doesn’t have to reload the full webpage to get a new page each time a user makes a new request. Instead, React intercepts the request and only fetches and changes the sections that need changing without having to trigger a full page reload. This approach results in better performance and a more dynamic user experience.

React relies on a virtual DOM, which is a copy of the actual DOM. React’s virtual DOM is immediately reloaded to reflect this new change whenever there is a change in the data state. After which, React compares the virtual DOM to the actual DOM to figure out what exactly has changed.

React then figures out the least expensive way to patch the actual DOM with that update without rendering the actual DOM. As a result, React’s components and UIs very quickly reflect the changes since you don’t have to reload an entire page every time something updates.

<dt>What is node js ?</dt>

<dd>Whenever a client requests something from the client side of the application what happens is , the request is first sent to the server and then in that server some processing or calculations goes on for the validation of the client side request and after doing all such validation a response is sent to the client side. Basically for doing all such calculations and processing , this NodeJs framework of JavaScript is used.

    For running our web applications outside the client’s browser , NodeJS is basically used as an open-source and cross platform JavaScript runtime environment.For running the server side applications we use this.For building the I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites ,online chatting applications and many other applications , it is used. Many established tech giant companies and newly created start-ups are using NodeJs framework in their company.
    
    In 2009, NodeJs was developed by a guy called Ryan Dahla and the current version of NodeJs is v16.9.0.

    Asynchronous in Nature and Event driven: The servers made with the NodeJs never waits for the from an API. Without waiting for the data from the API, it directly moves to the next API. So all the APIs of NodeJS are totally non-blocking in nature. In order to receive and track all the responses of the previous API requests, it follows an event driven mechanism. Hence we can say that all the NodeJs API are non-blocking in nature.
Single Threaded Architecture: With event looping, a single threaded architecture is followed by NodeJs and for this architecture makes NodeJs more scalable. In contrast to other servers, limited threads are created by them for processing the requests. Whereas for the event driven mechanism, the NodeJS servers reply in a non-blocking or an asynchronous manner and for this reason NodeJS becomes more scalable. If we compare NodeJs with other traditional servers like Apache HTTP servers, then we can say NodeJs handles a larger number of requests. A single threaded program is followed by NodeJS and this allows NodeJs to process a huge amount of requests.
Scalable: Nowadays, scalable software is demanded by most of the companies. One of the most pressing concerns in Software Development is addressed by NodeJs and that is scalability. Concurrent requests can be handled very efficiently using NodeJs. A cluster module is used by NodeJs for managing the load balancing for all the active CPU cores. The most appealing feature of NodeJs is that it can partition the applications horizontally and this partition procedure is mainly achieved by it due to the use of child processes. Using this feature, the distinct app versions are provided to the different target audiences and also for customization it allows them for catering to the client preferences.
Quick Execution time for code: V8 JavaScript runtime motor is used by NodeJs and this is also used by Google chrome. A wrapper is provided for the JavaScript by the hub and for that reason the runtime motor becomes faster and for this reason inside NodeJs, the preposition process of the requests also become faster.
Compatibility on the cross platforms: Different types of systems like Windows, UNIX, LINUX, MacOS and other mobile devices can use NodeJs. For generating a self-sufficient execution, it can be paired with any appropriate package.
<BR>
    <br>

Uses JavaScript: From an engineer's perspective, it is a very important aspect of NodeJs that this framework uses JavaScript Most of the developers are familiar with JavaScript, so for them it becomes very easier to grab NodeJs.
Fast Data Streaming: The processing time of the data that have been transmitted to different streams takes a long time. Whereas for processing the data, NodeJs takes a very short amount of time and it does it at a very fast rate. NodeJs saves a lot of time because the files are processed and uploaded simultaneously by NodeJs. So as a result, the overall speed of data and video streaming is improved by NodeJs.
